This project is part of The Odin Project in the full stack javaScript path. 
See [here](https://eveieve.github.io/TodoList2/) for the live preview. 

## technologies 
javaScript, HTML, CSS 

# features

* add projects with `Enter` and delete them with clicking delete buttons
* add tasks inside projects and delete them 
* edit each project & task title by double clicking
* expand a single task to write notes or set a due date 
* checkmark completed tasks 
* use local storage to persist data on the computer 

# for improvement 

- [ ] sort tasks in an ascending order, if due date has been set

- [ ] delete tasks completely when a project is deleted
